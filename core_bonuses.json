No effect, attack or character can pass through the shield unless you allow it, and you can control the conditions inside this area however you please (temperature, moisture, light level, etc).

    "description": "<div>Designed to accompany Rubbleborn pioneers in more hazardous conditions, the Hardlight Chrysalis creates a protective “shell” that can turn any hostile environment into a suitable atmosphere with comfortable conditions. The shell itself is the result of microscopic nano-cells projecting overlapping energy fields that constantly adapt wavelengths to ensure that no harmful radiation can enter. In environments with atmosphere, the nano-cells filter out toxic chemicals and can even improve air quality, while creating airtight environments in a vacuum and also blocking dangerous wavelengths of the EM spectrum. The power required to keep this field up, added to the necessity of exposing most of the frame's inner systems, creates a considerable risk when deploying the chrysalis. Because of this, it cannot be activated during high-intensity or combat situations, but residual nano-cells can act as an ablative layer over existing plating.</div>",
