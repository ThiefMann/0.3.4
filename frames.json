    "description": "<div>The first design made by the Rubblefolk following their contact with the wider galaxy, the Scarab is a defender first and foremost. Primarily meant to protect mining teams from debris and local wildlife, the Scarab quickly replaced its predecessor, the “Rubbleshield”. Widespread through the entirety of the planet’s Rubbleborn population, the simple base design of the Scarab provided a flexible basis to create civilian-grade working rigs: building, transport, caregivers, among countless others.</div><div>In the Rubble, Scarabs make up the majority of Protector Cadres, the defensive militia units that ensure no harm comes to the colony. Only once they are given enough training and upon reaching a certain age are Scarabs initiated into Protector Cadres, being granted the additional battery capacitors and energy projectors necessary for the deployment and control of their “Bulwark” nanites. Due to this personal growth required before the upgrade, no two Scarabs are the same, despite their massive numbers, their shields are their fingerprints. Each shield is unique in pattern, energy readings and shape, the creation of nano-cells linked together in a semi-solid energy field. These energy fields are not a new invention, but rather ubiquitous across Rubbleborn colonies, used for partitioning spaces, protecting valuable equipment, or retaining sleeping or dormant members of the Colony within their habitats; the novelty comes from the miniaturization of the nano-cell emitters.</div><div>It is not uncommon for Scarabs in Protector Cadres to bond with each other based on the similarities of their shields, usually evolving into squad bonds that can last decades as the shields sync with each other, increasing efficiency and defensive affinity.</div><div>The Scarab is considered to be the flagship product of Khepri Industrial Equipment, capable of augmenting other frames, or if deployed in full, homogenous squads, can be a near-unbreakable wall.</div>",

This leaves the Weevils with a larger amount of “free time” when compared to other Cadres; which, in the best cases, has led the Rubbleborn to incredible leaps in technological development. Weevil-led Hivebuilder Cadres present the largest variety within them, ranging from technical roles like science and engineering, while others fulfill cultural roles like arts, companionship, and recreational efforts.</div><div>To other Rubbleborn, Weevil are always welcome as friends and helpful hands, but to outsiders, their reception is much more mixed. Their innate drive to fix and repurpose components can evolve into kleptomaniac tendencies, and although the Rubbleborn are happy to trade trinkets with them to satiate this desire, JXC and Union materials tend to go missing when a Weevil is nearby, as they simply can't resist but grab new shinnies whenever they find them.</div>",

Rubbleborn pilots of the machine are often found to develop a sense of detachment which, combined with the increased interaction with Submind units, can lead to a sense of a disconnect between their core elements. Despite this, certain Rubbleborn- especially those consisting of “super-gestalt” subjectivities- tend to be most comfortable piloting a Hercules compared to more “restrictive” models.</div><div>Non-Rubbleborn pilots are warned to look out for signs that they might be developing similar sorts of psychological occurrences, and to seek counseling as soon as possible to process the overwhelming amount of information piloting the frame can provide.</div><div>Hercules models serve primarily as hubs and slow-but-steady long-distance transports. Concealed under its outer exoskeleton are magnetic clamps, force-field generators, and short-range remote access ports, and it is not uncommon to see a pack of Stags resting on the back of a Hercules, covering its blind spots in case of an ambush. Hercules models also often contain cramped-but-functional living quarters, field kitchens, Ambrosia nanite processors, or other necessities for long-duration travel.

By 5090u, not even two years after it first rolled out of the assembly forges, the Beetle would make up the vast majority of the juvenile population within The Rubble. It later served as the basis for the Scarab platform, its larger sibling, following the establishment of KIE. All Beetles are customized in some way and to different degrees: some are completely unrecognizable as Beetles, their endo- and exoskeletal structures modified so drastically that they are almost a separate platform, but GMS-standard components means that they can be rapidly replaced and interchanged when the need calls for it, something the Rubbleborn very much appreciate.</div><div>While its hardpoints are designed for tool integration, field refits can allow weapons to be mounted instead, and peripheral access ports allow Beetles to share their equipment with others. Short-range temporary “nest-minds” are able to share, broadcast, and assist in reacting to data of incoming situations, often autonomously alerting older or more powerful members of a colony to their peril.</div><div>Following its success in the Rubble, a deal would be struck up with GMS to license it across Union space, adapted for use by non-Rubbleborn. While not technically a product of the Off-World Division, and predating Khepri Industrial Equipment, it is included in the catalog due to its nature as a jointly-developed project.</div>",

In exchange for exotic underground materials, SSC was glad to add KIE-OWD to their list of licensed 3rd-party designers. The pristine frames sent to Rubble as reference models ended up scrapped or covered with sandstorm dust; their flexible platings, cloaking devices and fine blades finding use with the more reserved members of the colony. These would end up in use in an experimental research-and-development project in integrating “time crystals” harvested from Jovo and EX Slipstream Drive technologies, designated BLACK CARPET. By using a specialized chrono-crystalline control device, the BLACK CARPET project was capable of entering a parallel dimension to blinkspace. The unfortunate result of this was that this post-causality pocket led to a breakdown in any paracausal technologies due to incompatibilities, and the original test pilots would become stranded beyond the passage of time. While rescue attempts have been undertaken, none have been successful. Refinements would allow a temporary bubble of realspace and blinkspace to be preserved around the generator through adapted Aunic technologies, though this would leave a “shadow”. While difficult to replace and maintain, this “Shadowplay Generator” would be put into limited production, integrated with other BLACK CARPET technologies. The end result would be the Ghost Mantis.</div><div>Prior to the completion of the BLACK CARPET project, “Ghost Mantis” was merely a name given to Hunter Cadres that made scouting efforts of the massive tunnel systems, fending off invasive megafauna with concealed skirmishes that might last days at a time, taking out the pack leaders and other keystone individuals before picking off each individual until none are left and the tunnels are secure again. The chassis was named after these Cadres, and given to the most elite of them, where they proved their worth in eliminating a surge of Typhonic megafauna that could have ravaged the largest Ambrosia harvesting field for the Rubble.</div>",

    "description": "<div>This variant of the Genghis can be taken at rank II of the GENGHIS license instead of the base Frame, or gained as exotic gear through play.</div><div>Following contact with the outside world and the enhancement of their already-established industrial base, the Rubbleborn decided to use existing frames as testbeds. The first prototype of the Bombardier came out of this program as a specialized mining tool, using corrosive acids to dissolve rock into a softer slag substance, which other machines could more easily drill and collect. However, the acids- based on a compound created by combining the byproducts of a burrowing worm species with a lithovore microbe strain, designated \"Substance 07 / MCB\"- had to be diluted with a synthetic chemical to get any sort of large batch, and the process used made it unstable. Multiple prototypes underwent a spontaneous collapse as the acid tanks ate themselves from inside-out, and the project was shelved for the time being.</div><div>When the legal battle against Lysenko-Rasolka Limited was finished, Harrison Armory reached out to provide technical support in an attempt to obtain the resources of the Rubble some other way. Providing expertise in reactor confinement, and sharing data on their Genghis platform, additional systems were designed to stabilize and optimize Substance 07/MCB through a novel mixing chamber, providing a \"chemical furnace\". The internal stores of the compound's components were able to be kept inert and non-reactive until they were loaded into the chem-furnace, and integration with a shorter, lower-velocity version of the HA Iskander's Assault Launcher allowed for precision deployment of payloads in specific directions. When running hot, the compound could also be used as a pseudo-steroid for its artificial musculature, and when exposed to external heat, could form a temporary insulating layer.</div><div>The finalized Bombardier proved to be so effective that it soon became standard-issue for all mining operations run by the Rubbleborn, and several have made their way into the hands of the Jovo Extraction Conglomerate as a gesture of goodwill.</div>",

    "description": "<div>The COLEOPTERAN is an artillery chassis developed by Khepri Industrial Equipment’s Offworld Developments branch that all characters have access to from LL0 onwards. This variant FRAME is not mutually exclusive with the EVEREST.</div><div>Following the Beetle’s overall success as an export platform, several members of the KIE-OWD branch decided to have another go at the concept, this time building the machine from scratch. Like most KIE projects, the design team focused on their needs and extrapolated the requirements from there. First, the rising threat of the Typhonspawn required something that was more mobile than the Hercules platform, which had previously formed the bulk of any artillery units and backline support. Second, they required a “trooper mech” that could be used by mostly anyone with very little in the way of dedicated training, and thirdly, they wanted something that showed off the special properties of Rubbleborn technology. Thus, “Project Beetle II” was initiated, only to quickly be renamed to “Project Coleoptera” after one of its design leads decided that would be a better moniker.</div><div>The Coleopteran applies HiveMind technology to the battlefield in a somewhat novel way: by creating an internal “FrameMind” that links together several smaller targeting subminds, a similar sort of gestalt intelligence would form to constantly optimize weaponry. While this makes any of these weapons vulnerable to jammers and other forms of electronic countermeasures, its ability to “Fire and Forget” was unparalleled: by allowing the onboard submindsto address incoming threats, the user could focus on mobility rather than targeting, including on shots that should not be possible at a conventional skill level. Machine-learning algorithms also take into account past and simulated-future combat data, allowing each weapon to be pushed beyond its limits.</div><div>The Coleopteran has seen limited initial release, primarily as militia-mechs for settlements, though the Frame’s data was uploaded into the Omninet by a particularly excitable member of the design team. The ramifications of a networked, self-aiming battle platform on worlds outside of Jovo and the Tsarina System as a whole had unfortunately escaped the considerations of its design team, much to the chagrin of the DOJ/HR contingent at Camp Fireside.</div>",
