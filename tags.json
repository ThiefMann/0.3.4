    "description": "<div>Any Action or Reaction granted by an EUSOCIAL system can be used by an adjacent allied character as long as you, the Host Character, allow them to do so. Eusocial weapons can be used to Skirmish or Barrage by adjacent allies as if they had them installed (such as Barraging with one installed weapon and one Eusocial weapon). If Range, Burst, Blast, Cone, Line, or Threat are specified as part of the action (such as a Weaponâ€™s profile), it is drawn from the User, not the Host. When a Character uses an ally's Eusocial Weapon or System, that Weapon or system counts as if it was equipped by that User Character, benefiting from their talents, traits, core bonuses, etc, and taking any other effects caused by the system or weapon with the following exceptions: </div><ul><li><div>The Host character takes any heat generated by the System or Weapon. </div></li></ul><ul><li><div>If the Eusocial Weapon or System has the Limited property, the Host must spend charges as normal, and the number of Charges cannot be modified by any of the User's characters modifiers (such as the Engineering skill). </div></li></ul><ul><li><div>Use restrictions (such as 1/round, 1/scene, Loading, Danger Zone, etc) are shared between both the User and Host character, meaning that if a User character activates a 1/scene Eusocial system, that System cannot be used for the rest of the scene by either character.<br></div></li></ul>"
