While the Rubblefolk term for both roughly translates to “Food/Fuel/Cells of Life”, an early error with the translation software used by the USB at Camp Fireside resulted in both being designated as “Ambrosia”. The Jovocyte component of Ambrosia is a robust, extremophile strain seemingly domesticated by the mysterious first colonists of Jovo, lacking many of the directly-harmful heavy metals that other Jovocyte species possess. The nano-cell component exists to filter out said heavy metals and compact them into usable growths that can be harvested for future use, while the biomatter can be used for fuel and to provide biomass for the Cloning Gardens. With the invention of the Weevil chassis, both Hivebuilder and Hiveworker alike have adopted these machines for use in harvesting, processing, and seeding Ambrosia stockpiles, which are essential for allowing a new colony to take root. The trading of Ambrosia strains between Rubbleborn and settlements such as Oasis have proven to be vital in ensuring some measure of goodwill between the recently-contacted posthumans and the overworlders.</em></div>",
